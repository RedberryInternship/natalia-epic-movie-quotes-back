## Epic Movie Quotes

Epic Movie Quotes is a bilingual application built using the React and Laravel frameworks. The application provides a platform for movie enthusiasts to register, authorize and upload their favorite quotes from various movies. Users can create an account, log in and add their own quotes or browse through the quotes posted by other users.

Upon logging in, users can view a feed of quotes uploaded by other users, with the ability to like and comment on their posts. Users can also view their own uploaded quotes and manage them from their account.

The application is designed with real-time notifications so that quote's author is notified immediately while her post is liked or commented on.
